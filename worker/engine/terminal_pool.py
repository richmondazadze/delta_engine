"""
MT5 follower pool — parallel across brokers, serial within a shared terminal.

One ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` (single worker) is created per *pool key*:

- **Dedicated key** (one account on a terminal path): warm session stays on that
  login — fastest for a single follower on that install.
- **Shared key** (multiple accounts on the same ``terminal64.exe``): one subprocess
  serialises jobs and switches login per follower. Required because MT5 only
  supports one active login per terminal instance.

For 5–20 followers on the *same* broker with one install, jobs queue on the
shared worker (correct). For maximum parallel throughput, give each account its
own portable MT5 folder and unique ``terminal_path`` in the database.
